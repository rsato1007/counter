# Overview
This project is a recreation of React. The purpose is to develop a deep understanding of how React works internally.

# Challenges
When I initally started this project, I was following a tutorial that walks you through creating a basic version of React.
However, I felt the tutorial wasn't the best and so I decided to start over. Plus I wanted to see if I could recreate it using TypeScript.

# Techonologies
- TypeScript/JavaScript
- Babel
